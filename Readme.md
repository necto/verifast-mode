A simple [VeriFast](https://github.com/verifast/verifast) mode for Emacs.

To use it, you'll need just the `verifast-mode.el` file. Open it in your Emacs and evaluate it (`M-x` `eval-buffer`), than open the file you want to edit (verifast/bin/list.gh) and type `verifast-mode` if for some reason emacs did not enable it automatically.

To run tests you'll need Emacs 25 and the [`assess`](https://github.com/phillord/assess) `ert` extension.
